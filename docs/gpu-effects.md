# File-based GPU effects

All effect presets are GPU packages under `effects/` (`backend: "gpu"`). Preview and export share `FrameCompositor` → `EffectProcessor` → `GpuEffectExecutor`.

## Package layout

```

## effect.json

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` / `displayName` / `category` / `order` | Catalog metadata |
| `thumbnail` | Optional image path (relative to package, or absolute). Defaults to `thumbnail.png` when that file exists |
| `backend` | `"gpu"` or `"model3d"` |
| `parameters[]` | User-facing uniforms — see the parameter types below |
| `fixedParams` | Hidden uniforms (colors as `#rrggbb`, enums as strings) |
| `requires` | `"face"` to receive the baked face anchors (see below). Any other value is a parse error |
| `pipeline` | `intermediateBuffers` + `passes` |

### Parameter types

| `type` | Binds as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `float` (default) | `float` | `minValue`/`maxValue`/`defaultValue`; keyframable |
| `bool` / `boolean` | `float` (0 or 1) | Rendered as a switch; not keyframable |
| `color` / `colour` | `vec3` | `defaultValue` is a `"#rrggbb"` string; rendered as a swatch |
| `file` | *(not bound)* | Absolute path string; `fileFilters` for the picker. Used by `model3d` |

Colour parameters bind as **`vec3`** — alpha is dropped, so declare a separate opacity float if you
need one. Any alpha in `defaultValue` is discarded at parse time and the value is normalized to six
digits. Colours and file paths are **not keyframable**: the whole keyframe stack is typed `double`.

Pass inputs: `source_texture` (+ optional `index`), `buffer` (+ `id`), or `texture` (+ `id`). Multiple inputs bind as `u_currentTexture` (unit 0) and `u_texture1`…  
Pass outputs: `buffer` or `canvas`.

`pipeline.textures[]` declares static image assets loaded once from the package dir:

```json
"textures": [{ "id": "glyphs", "file": "glyphs.png" }]
```

## GLSL

- `#version 330 core`
- Reserved: `u_currentTexture`, `u_textureN`, `u_resolution`, `u_time`, `u_timeUs`, `u_frameIndex`, `u_progress`, `u_fromTexture`, `u_toTexture`

**Grace mode:** compile/GL failure → passthrough.

## Face effects

A package with `"requires": "face"` receives the clip's baked landmarks. It should also declare a
`faceIndex` float 0–3, which selects which tracked person to follow — the engine **consumes** that
parameter rather than binding it.

Two coordinate conventions are in play, and mixing them up produces elliptical warps:

- **Positions** (`u_faceLeftEyeX`, …) are in **uv**: 0–1, top-left origin.
- **Lengths, angles and every contour loop** are **width-normalized**: uv with y scaled by the frame
  aspect, so a radius means the same thing along both axes. Rebuild that space from `u_resolution`
  with `vec2 toLocal(vec2 uv, float aspect) { return vec2(uv.x, uv.y * aspect); }`.

### Uniforms

| Uniform | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `u_faceValid` | `float` | **`< 0.5` means pass the frame through untouched.** Every face shader must honour this |
| `u_faceLeftEye`/`RightEye`/`Nose`/`Mouth`/`MouthLeft`/`MouthRight`/`Chin`/`Forehead`/`Center` `X`,`Y` | `float` | uv. Left/right are **image**-side, not the subject's |
| `u_faceRx`, `u_faceRy`, `u_faceAngle`, `u_faceEyeRadius` | `float` | Face oval half-axes, eye-line tilt, iris radius |
| `u_faceHasContours` | `float` | 0 for a sidecar baked before contours existed. Treat like `u_faceValid` |
| `u_faceOval[36]`, `u_faceLipOuter[20]`, `u_faceLipInner[20]`, `u_faceEyeLeft[16]`, `u_faceEyeRight[16]`, `u_faceBrowLeft[10]`, `u_faceBrowRight[10]` | `vec2[]` | Closed loops. Eye rings run inner corner → **upper** lid → outer corner, so indices 0–8 are the lash line |
| `u_faceCheekLeftX/Y`, `u_faceCheekRightX/Y` | `float` | uv |
| `u_facePoseValid` | `float` | 0 when the pose could not be derived |
| `u_facePoseRight`/`Up`/`Fwd` `X`,`Y`,`Z` | `float` | Orthonormal head basis. `Fwd` points **out of the face toward the viewer** |
| `u_facePoseOriginX/Y/Z`, `u_facePoseScale` | `float` | Eye midpoint and interocular distance |
| `u_faceYaw`, `u_facePitch`, `u_faceRoll` | `float` | Radians, derived from the basis for shaders that only want an angle |

Both `u_faceValid` and `u_faceHasContours` must be checked by anything using the loops:

```glsl
if (u_faceValid < 0.5 || u_faceHasContours < 0.5) { fragColor = texture(u_currentTexture, v_texCoord); return; }
```

**Uniform budget.** The seven loops together are 256 components. GL 3.3 core guarantees at least
1024 fragment default-block components, and no shipping package declares more than about 220 — but
this is why the full 468-point mesh is not delivered this way.

**No `#include`.** The package loader materializes each `.frag` verbatim. The polygon SDF helper is
duplicated into every beauty package on purpose, which is also what keeps a package self-contained
enough to redistribute as an addon. If that becomes a burden, the fix is an `"includes"` array
concatenated at parse time in `loadGpuPipeline` — the program cache keys off the materialized
source, so `GlRuntime` would need no change.

**Sidecar compatibility.** Face tracks are format v2; v1 files still load, with `hasContours` and
`hasPose` false. That is why the guard above is a pass-through rather than an error, and why the
inspector offers a re-detect when a Beauty effect meets an older track.

## Special case: time_echo

History frames are still decoded in `FrameCompositor`; blending runs on the GPU via `GpuEffectExecutor::blendTimeEcho` (CPU fallback if GL is unavailable).

## 3D face props (`backend: "model3d"`)

Not a fragment pipeline — there is no `.frag`. The package declares parameters only; the engine
loads a user-supplied `.glb`, attaches it to the tracked head pose, and composites with an optional
head-proxy occlusion pass.

- Orthographic MVP from `(faceCenter, faceRx, pose, user params, aspect)` — never a pixel size, so
  preview at `renderScale 0.5` and export at 1.0 produce a bit-identical matrix. Depth maps as
  `z_ndc = −z_wn / 4` so `+forward` (toward the viewer) is nearer in the GL depth buffer.
- Lighting is **screen-space** (fixed relative to the frame) and approximate Blinn-Phong in sRGB —
  the rest of the compositor is untagged 8-bit, so linearizing the model alone would look foreign.
- Materials: `baseColorFactor` / `baseColorTexture`, metallic/roughness scalars, emissive factor,
  OPAQUE/MASK/BLEND, double-sided. Draco / meshopt compressed meshes are refused with a specific
  message. Skinned meshes render in bind pose with a warning.
- Props live in the `face-props` addon kind (`DRIFT_FACE_PROPS_DIR`). Starter GLBs ship from the
  separate `drift-addons` repo — nothing asset-shaped enters this tree.
- The `face_model_3d` package ships `markers.glb` as its default model: coloured dots at the eye
  midpoint, eyes, nose, mouth, chin, forehead and cheeks in head-width space, so custom props can
  be authored against the same place markers. See `effects/face_model_3d/README.md`.
- Failure mode: skip the effect, keep the frame. Empty path is silent (cleared model param).
